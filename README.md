## About the Video Course
What do self-driving cars, face recognition, web search, industrial robots, missile guidance, and tumor detection have in common? They are all complex real-world problems being solved with applications of intelligence (AI). This course provides you with a broad understanding of the basic techniques for building intelligent computer systems and an understanding of how AI is applied to problems.

In this course, you will progress to advanced AI techniques and concepts, and work on real-life datasets on how training works, model evaluation and how to process their first dataset in Supervised and Unsupervised Learning. You will be introduced to neural networks, machine Learning, and Deep Learning. You will understand the concept of Artificial Intelligence and how it is applicable in the enterprise context. You will then cover the basics of machine learning relate how Deep Learning and AI fits with them.
